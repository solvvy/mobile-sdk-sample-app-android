New Features
------------

- [30606] Implement Certificate Transparency Library.

  Certificate Transparency aims to remedy these certificate-based threats by making the issuance 
  and existence of SSL certificates open to scrutiny by domain owners, CAs, and domain users.

  This version implements this approach to prevent malicious websites if they’re provisioned 
  with mistakenly issued certificates or certificates that have been issued by a certificate
  authority (CA) that’s been compromised or gone rogue.

Fixes
-----

- [30656] Android SDK allows more than 10MB of attachments.

  Improves the attach files to prevent OutOfMemory issues that were crashing the application.
